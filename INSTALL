Achatina requires Tcl 8.6 or newer and Tcllib (http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/).

Installation of Achatina is very simple and straightforward. You only have
to complete following two steps:

1. Copy contents of "lib" directory somewhere in your Tcl library path. To find out
   where libraries should be located, run tclsh and enter "[file dirname [info library]]".

2. Copy contents of "bin" directory somewhere in your PATH.
